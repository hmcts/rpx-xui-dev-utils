# PR-Bot-Data storage file

This `state.json` file acts as a centralised database that tracks the approval status of all open pull requests across 8 EXUI repos, enabling the PR bot to post a message (in the head position) in a chosen slack channel containing a synchronised view of which PRs need acting upon.
